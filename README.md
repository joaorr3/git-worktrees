# git-worktrees-explorer

This extension provides a GUI for managing git worktrees. You can add, delete and switch between them.

## Features

- Add a new worktree by creating a new branch or from selection an existing one.
- A new directory will be created for you based on the current branch path. For ex. Your repo is called `MyAwesomeRepo` and you've added a new worktree from a branch called `MyAwesomeBranch`. A new directory called `MyAwesomeRepo.worktrees` will be created with a folder `MyAwesomeBranch` inside it.
